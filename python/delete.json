We're going to get you an internship, we're going to get you a job, and we're going to get you PAID. I understand that the current job market is difficult to get into, not just for UNCW students, but for computer science majors as a whole. This site contains information that will help you in your job search and in your academic career. I also included some other more general topics throughout the website that I thought you might like. If you want me to add a section or want me to elaborate or add more information to an existing section, please don't hesitate to Contact me."

During college I had two SWE internships, one at USAA and the other at a startup company called Amotions, Inc. I've also received a couple other full-time and internship offers as well. My situation is somewhat rare for a UNCW alumni and I want to help get you in the same boat, if that's something you're interested in. So far, I've successfully helped a friend of mine at UNCW (class of 2025) get a SWE internship at USAA and I feel like I've developed pretty good job-searching strategies over the years. I think you would find some of these techniques and strategies useful, so I've shared them fairly in depth throughout this website. As mentioned earlier, if you need any help with anything please do not hesitate to contact me. Definitely don't hesitate to spam me with questions, I'd be more than happy to answer all of them to the best of my ability."

I could help you through the interview process, and if you did your internship in Plano I could help you with housing. You could also set job alerts using this link -&gt; Here. Go to the bottom section of the page titled \"Join our talent community\" and enter your information to subscribe to their job alert mailing list. Also the return offer rate for full-time positions at USAA is VERY high (~85%) so keep that in mind through the process. This is a very fun, easy, low-stress internship with lots of great learning and networking opportunities. You'll meet a lot of other college kids in the same boat as you, which I think is good.",

Dr. Ellithorpe also understands that people are taking the class as an elective and aren't history majors, so he makes it relatively easy and fun. The grades are just quizzes, 3 easy essays, and 4 tests of the same length. The historical periods covered are the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece, Rome, and Medieval Europe.

The project is a JavaFx project written using Java, JavaFx, FXML, and SceneBuilder. JavaFx is a framework for building GUI's for Java. It adds logic to your FXML code, and you can use it to build UI components programmatically in your project, I did both in ours.

There are no tests or quizzes in this class which I really liked. It's just programming assignments and math assignments. The math is like more simple calculus concepts and written mathematical computing problems. It typically explains how to do the problems in the videos so definitely watch them. The programming assignments can be challenging at times. I basically lived in her office hours that semester to ensure that I got a good grade in this class. The programming assignments are in Python and involve most image analysis algorithms using opencv and numpy. If you're struggling definitely watch her videos and go to her office hours.

I also liked when the professor would discuss the history of computing, future of artificial intelligence, and other stuff like that. I would HIGHLY recommend taking this class with Dr. Curry Guinn. He's more then happy to help you with stuff and is a good teacher/nice person. Also at the end you do a writing assignment on a book about Alan Turing's life. While I would always do my work in college, I didn't read a single page of the book and still got a 100% on the assignment. I just skimmed parts of it online and used chatGPT.

The more useful parts of the class include learning about memory-management, compilers, and other programming language concepts. There are 3 tests throughout each worth 17% of your final grade. The tests are infamously difficult and I'd recommend studying your notes from class, slides, and homeworks. At the end there is a 20-minute long group presentation on a programming language. Most groups have 3 members and my group was assigned Kotlin. We got a 100 on the project and he basically said it was a \"give me\" completion grade.

The math is like more simple calculus concepts and written mathematical computing problems. It typically explains how to do the problems in the videos so definitely watch them. The programming assignments can be challenging at times. I basically lived in her office hours that semester to ensure that I got a good grade in this class.

The more useful parts of the class include learning about memory-management, compilers, and other programming language concepts. There are 3 tests throughout each worth 17% of your final grade. The tests are infamously difficult and I'd recommend studying your notes from class, slides, and homeworks. At the end there is a 20-minute long group presentation on a programming language. Most groups have 3 members and my group was assigned Kotlin. We got a 100 on the project and he basically said it was a \"give me\" completion grade.
