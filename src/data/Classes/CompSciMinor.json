            "Description": "I've recently learned that you're a Business Administration major, not a Computer Science major. I think a computer science minor could still be very helpful and enhance your degree. Basically all modern businesses use and rely on Software, so it'd be useful to have a basic understanding of it. It can also help automate excel tasks. Learn more about the minor [here](https://uncw.edu/academics/majors-programs/cse/computer-science-minor/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwzN-vBhAkEiwAYiO7oBoInQTdiPLGK78yFVc886jh_agnyvdVbJTZ-M2EyOmiGyhkvMwxaRoCP-MQAvD_BwE). For the minor you need to take CSC 131, CSC 133, CSC 231, CSC 331, and two 3-credit hour CSC electives. These are descriptions of those classes and two possible electives.",
            "Major": "Computer Science Major",
            "DescriptionTwo": "It's probably not too late to become a computer science major with a business concentration and still graduate in 4 years. I've listed coursework below. To learn more about the degree run a \"What-If\" analysis in [Seanet](https://degreeworks-respdashboard.uncw.edu/RespDashboard/worksheets/WEB31).

She lets you have a cheat sheet for the tests. For one lab you work in a group of 3. At the end you work in a group of 5 for a 10-minute long project presentation. The project is a JavaFx project written using Java, JavaFx, FXML, and SceneBuilder. JavaFx is a framework for building GUI's for Java. It adds logic to your FXML code, and you can use it to build UI components programmatically in your project, I did both in ours. I personally really like the framework and the end project was definitely my favorite programming project I did for UNCW.",

The class itself is very easy and I found it's content interesting. You do 4 easy python programming assignments throughout and a couple easy multiple-choice online quizzes. The final-exam is an online taken-home coding assessment. In class Layman, shows many real life examples of things, and demonstrates concepts using JavaScript, html, C, Python, SQL, etc. While you don't have to write in these languages (except Python) just seeing them in use would probably be helpful in learning the basics of them. Overall an extremely easy class without that much work. Would highly recommend.",

All you do is write 1 paragraph a week summarizing what you did at your internship and at the end you create a poster presentation demonstrating what you did during your internship.

I only had like 2 people come up to ask me about it during the 2-hour showcase. Also, it's just a completion grade, so it's pretty low-stress. The computing showcase is a great place to meet and talk to employers in the Wilmington area. @This was my poster@[{ 'name': 'ImageView', 'params': { 'Name': 'Amotions Poster', 'Description': 'This was my CSC 498 poster for the computing showcase.
