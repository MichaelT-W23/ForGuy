Overall the amount of work and difficulty of this class isn't worth it for an elective class. This class is mostly just graphs and python search algorithms. If you want to learn more about actual artificial intelligence, I'd recommend you get a certification.

Dr. Ellithorpe is an amazing professor and teaches history in a super entertaining story-telling way. There were times I was on edge of my seat borderline shaking at how exciting the stories were. Dr. Ellithorpe also understands that people are taking the class as an elective and aren't history majors, so he makes it relatively easy and fun. The grades are just quizzes, 3 easy essays, and 4 tests of the same length. The historical periods covered are the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece, Rome, and Medieval Europe. Tragically, Dr. Ellithorpe appears to now be working at the [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/history/people/corey-ellithorpe.aspx). Hopefully he'll come back to UNCW someday.",

The math is like more simple calculus concepts and written mathematical computing problems. It typically explains how to do the problems in the videos so definitely watch them. The programming assignments can be challenging at times. I basically lived in her office hours that semester to ensure that I got a good grade in this class.

                "Description": "This was definitely one of my least favorite classes in the UNCW comp sci curriculum. At the beginning of the class you write parts of made-up UNCW programming language called \"Jiffy\" using Java. After that you work with mostly [SML](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/introml/) and [Prolog](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/prolog/prolog_basic_programs.htm). I don't think there's any real reason to know these languages and found that large part of the class kind of pointless. The more useful parts of the class include learning about memory-management, compilers, and other programming language concepts. There are 3 tests throughout each worth 17% of your final grade. The tests are infamously difficult and I'd recommend studying your notes from class, slides, and homeworks. At the end there is a 20-minute long group presentation on a programming language. Most groups have 3 members and my group was assigned Kotlin. We got a 100 on the project and he basically said it was a \"give me\" completion grade. However, I consider us lucky as Kotlin was one of the more well-known languages he assigned. Some obscure ones I saw included Erlang, Clojure, F#, Groovy, etc. More well-known ones included C#, Kotlin, and Ruby.",
                "Skills": "SML, Prolog, Java, Skippy",
                "Tips": "He sometimes asks obscure questions about stuff you only learned in class on tests, so take notes.",

                "Description": "This class is pretty straight forward. You're basically assigned to a group of 5 people at the beginning and work on a software engineering project the entire time. The project must have a backend and frontend. There are like 3 quizzes you take online at home. The rest of the grade is just milestones and attendance. Milestones are basically progress points in the project. At the end you have a 20 minute presentation. Note that for the presentation not everyone has to speak.",

The first part of this class is just like databases graphs and showing how the keys are connected to each other or whatever. The second part is SQL and writing queries for a database. The last part is php and a group project. I enjoyed the group project and you don't present it. You don't present it because everyone basically does the same thing. Also, the labs you do throughout are completion grades and the Final Exam is the same format as the first two tests.",
