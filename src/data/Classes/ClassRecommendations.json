The periods covered were predominantly Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, Muslim Empire, Viking, and Old England. The class was 3 super easy essays, 4 tests (all the same length), and a couple quizzes throughout. Tragically, it seems like Dr. Ellithorpe is now teaching at the [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/history/people/corey-ellithorpe.aspx). However, I'd definitely watch out to see if he comes back and take it with him if possible."

The grades are 4 short/relatively easy coding assignments, a take home coding exam for the final you have a week to finish, and online take home quizzes throughout. The topics covered are super relevant to real world software engineering. The information I learned from this class came up a lot in job interviews so I‚Äôd definitely recommend it. Super easy A. Also Dr. Layman gives very generous extra credit."

All you have to do in this class is write one paragraph a week about what you did in your internship and at the end you present your poster at the computing showcase. The \"presentation\" is extremely easy and you just stand by your poster. I only had like two people come up to me the entire time to ask me about my poster. You don't present in front of a group. The class is pass/fail and you can't sign for it using seanet. Email Mrs. White (turners@uncw.edu) to express your interest and she'll help you sign up. Note that your internship supervisor should say you're working 15 hours a week to get the full 3 credit hours.

All we would do is open note quizzes that's questions just were copied and pasted facts directly from the slides with a word left out. The quizzes were open notes/internet as well. We also did 2 extremely short easy concert review papers. You could tell he seriously didn't care about grading stuff or making the class hard.  Unfortunately Dr. Fife seems to now be teaching at [Winthrop University](https://www.winthrop.edu/cvpa/faculty-staff/bios/fife-nicholas.aspx). I'd still keep an eye out, maybe he'll come back. Also I'm sure this class would be pretty easy no matter the format or professor."

The tests are also basically the exact same as the study guide. I got an A- in this class because of him. 10/10 would recommend."

Dr. Guinn is a great professor and very nice wholesome person. I went to his office hours once and he acted like I was his childhood best friend who he hadn't seen in like 30 years. He's also more than happy to help you out if you needed it. Would recommend."
